<!-- Abstract
------ -->
<!-- Multiple federal programs have sought to expand residential broadband service to unserved and underserved communities. These programs, however, have had varying levels of success. For instance, a 2024 study examining the Connect America Fund (CAF) uncovered a significant gap between the service that Internet Service Providers (ISPs) promised regulators they offered and the service that ISPs actually advertised to users: Only 33% of residential addresses covered by CAF funding are actually able to subscribe to broadband service that meets the Federal Communications Commission's service and cost requirements, and only 55% of addresses have access to any service. Motivated by these findings, we investigate possible causes of these low serviceability rates, in part by determining whether newer programs, such as the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund (RDOF), affected ISPs' compliance with CAF program rules. To do so, we integrate public address-level data from the Universal Service Administrative Company with a novel dataset of ISP serviceability and pricing, collected using the Broadband-plan Querying Tool. We also use data identifying unserved and underserved locations under the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program to identify overlaps between CAF, RDOF, and BEAD, with the aim of identifying locations and ISPs that have received repeated funding under multiple programs. In summary, we find that low CAF serviceability cannot be attributed to competition from RDOF. Our work helps illuminate a fragmented landscape of broadband funding programs, one in which billions of federal dollars are redundantly allocated to ISPs to serve previously funded locations, even as many rural locations lack adequate broadband service. -->
