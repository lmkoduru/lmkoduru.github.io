About me
------
Iâ€™m a Computer Science Ph.D. student at the University of California, Santa Barbara, working under the supervision of Professor [Arpit Gupta](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~arpitgupta/) in the Systems and Networking Lab and Professor [Elizabeth Belding](https://ebelding.cs.ucsb.edu) in the Mobility Management and Networking (MOMENT) Lab.

My research is focused on enabling data-driven policymaking to achieve universal access to high-quality and affordable broadband networks. Currently, I am leading the development of an AI-based querying system that mimics human interactions with ISPs' web portals to scale up data collection efficiently.


Interests
------
My interests lie at the intersection of data-driven policymaking, machine learning, and systems.
