About me
------
I am a Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department at the University of California, Santa Barbara, advised by Professor [Arpit Gupta](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~arpitgupta/) and Professor [Elizabeth Belding](https://ebelding.cs.ucsb.edu).

Interests
------
My interests lie at the intersection of data-driven policymaking, networking, machine learning, and systems. 

Research
------
My research is focused on enabling data-driven policymaking to achieve universal access to high-quality and affordable broadband networks.  This involves addressing the disparities in internet access and digital equity, which inform policy actions like subsidy programs, rate regulations, and infrastructure funding. However, a significant gap exists between the broadband data currently used for policy decisions and the precise data needed. Often, these datasets are sparse, noisy, or based on unreliable self-reported information, leading to potentially flawed funding decisions that disproportionately affect underserved areas. To address this, there is an urgent need to develop a sustainable, open digital infrastructure to bridge this data gap and provide accurate data for effective policymaking.
